# This is a list of carbon daemons we will send any relayed or
# generated metrics to. The default provided would send to a single
# carbon-cache instance on the default port. However if you
# use multiple carbon-cache instances then it would look like this:
#
# DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004:a, 127.0.0.1:2104:b
# 
# The format is comma-delimited IP:PORT:INSTANCE where the :INSTANCE part is
# optional and refers to the "None" instance if omitted.
#
# Note that if the destinations are all carbon-caches then this should
# exactly match the webapp's CARBONLINK_HOSTS setting in terms of
# instances listed (order matters!).
DESTINATIONS = 127.0.0.1:2004

# If you want to add redundancy to your data by replicating every
# datapoint to more than one machine, increase this.
REPLICATION_FACTOR = 1

# This is the maximum number of datapoints that can be queued up
# for a single destination. Once this limit is hit, we will
# stop accepting new data if USE_FLOW_CONTROL is True, otherwise
# we will drop any subsequently received datapoints.
MAX_QUEUE_SIZE = 10000

# Set this to False to drop datapoints when any send queue (sending datapoints
# to a downstream carbon daemon) hits MAX_QUEUE_SIZE. If this is True (the
# default) then sockets over which metrics are received will temporarily stop accepting
# data until the send queues fall below 80% MAX_QUEUE_SIZE.
USE_FLOW_CONTROL = True

# This defines the maximum "message size" between carbon daemons.
# You shouldn't need to tune this unless you really know what you're doing.
MAX_DATAPOINTS_PER_MESSAGE = 500

# This defines how many datapoints the aggregator remembers for
# each metric. Aggregation only happens for datapoints that fall in
# the past MAX_AGGREGATION_INTERVALS * intervalSize seconds.

# By default (WRITE_BACK_FREQUENCY = 0), carbon-aggregator will write back
# aggregated data points once every rule.frequency seconds, on a per-rule basis.
# Set this (WRITE_BACK_FREQUENCY = N) to write back all aggregated data points
# every N seconds, independent of rule frequency. This is useful, for example,
# to be able to query partially aggregated metrics from carbon-cache without
# having to first wait rule.frequency seconds.
# WRITE_BACK_FREQUENCY = 0

# Set this to True to enable whitelisting and blacklisting of metrics in
# CONF_DIR/whitelist and CONF_DIR/blacklist. If the whitelist is missing or
# empty, all metrics will pass through
# USE_WHITELIST = False

# By default, carbon itself will log statistics (such as a count,
# metricsReceived) with the top level prefix of 'carbon' at an interval of 60
# seconds. Set CARBON_METRIC_INTERVAL to 0 to disable instrumentation
